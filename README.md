## Blog Windows Form Application `Entity Framework CRUD`

    * Build a Blog Windows form application with register and login forms.
    * Make the user add his news and there's an option to view all news by its catalog.
    * I used Entity Framework Core with Code First Approach to build my application.
    * The user registers to the application and starts to enter his news in the blog with all its data.
      then he can navigate with all news based on its catalog or add, edit, and delete his news.
